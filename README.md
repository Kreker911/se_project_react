# WTWR (What to Wear?)

Or Weather Tailored Wardrobe Recommender, utilizes external weather data. The application offers personalized clothing suggestions to users, taking into account the current weather conditions in their local area.

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.
